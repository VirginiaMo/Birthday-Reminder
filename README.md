This is a Birthday Reminder App done with React js.

The idea is to use this app as a birthday reminder of your friends. I have created several components, where I've coded using events such as onClick and I've added an useState hook to grab the data, placing it in a container where we can see our friends photos with their names and ages.
And also I've added some style with css and the Material-UI library. 
This is a responsive app to work with different screen sizes.
